# once Gemfile has been created, we use bundler to install the gems, then lock them down 
# to versions being used with 'bundle install --without production'. This creates a file Gemfile.lock
# containing all gems we are using as well as their dependencies.
# the --without production flag ensures that any gems placed in production group aren't 
# installed locally.
